Our family and friends [voted on our honeymoon](http://localhost:4000/wedding/honeymoon.html)
and we found out at our reception that Finland received the majority of 
ballots (by a landslide).

We're going to the [Kakslauttanen resort](http://www.kakslauttanen.fi) 
where we'll stay in a glass-domed igloo to take in the Northern Lights,
and go on a reindeer safari.

Our estimated departure is mid-March.
